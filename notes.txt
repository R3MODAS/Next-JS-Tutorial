Pre-rendering
==============
Next js pre-renders the HTML of each page in advance instead of all the work done by client-side Javascript. It results in better page performance and SEO.

 First Generated HTML             Page is Loaded
-----------------------      --------------------------
HTML (Minimal JS code)   =>  Js code for the page loads and page
                             becomes fully interactive. (Adding Event and stuffs)

This process is known as hydration.
                
Content Delivery Network (CDN)
==============================
It is a network of servers linked together with a goal of delivering content as quickly and securely as possible. Our sites can be cached onto these server and can be provided quickly to the user.

Pages and Layout in Nextjs
===========================
To navigate to different page, first create a folder with the name of the page (about)then inside that create page.tsx which is the index file for the (About Page).

Now on the searchbar of the browser type http:localhost:3000/about and voila! 
You are now on the About Page thanks to File based Routing support in Next.js.

so the page.tsx is the index file for any page and now about the layout.tsx file. 
inside the layout file we can see the html head and all and we can see it is wrapping all the children (all the pages/component we make) so here we can put Navbar component and it will be available for all the pages/routes we go.

Now we want to apply something that is only for a specific page and not for every page so to do that we can create layout.tsx file inside the folder of the page (About page / Contact page) then just define the Navbar and then the children meaning all the content of the about page will come after the Navbar.
